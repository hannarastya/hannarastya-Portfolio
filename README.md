# Hanna Rastya Muliawati - Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Hanna! I have an academic background in Statistics with a concentration in Data Science, and a strong passion for turning data into actionable insights. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I developed solid analytical and technical skills through hands-on projects in statistical data analysis, business intelligence, and data visualization. 

During my studies, I refined my skill to spot trends and extrect insights and learned how to manage and interpret large-scale datasets. I also built experience in statistical modeling, data processing, and using various tools (such as R, SQL, and Python) to explore and visualize information which I believe these experinces have prepared me well to take on challenges in data-driven role and contribute meaningful analysis to support decision-making.

Besides, I have professional experience as working as a field enumerator for BPS and interning at Bappeda Yogyakarta, have sharpened my ability to collecting and manage data in real-world contexts, from socioeconomic factors to spatial and demographic datasets. Iâ€™ve also explored data visualization tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Google Data Studio to communicate insights effectively.

In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new data tools and diving into projects that challenge me to think critically. I am eager to grow as a data analyst by continuing to learn, solve real-world problems, and contribute meaningfully to data-driven decision-making.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Topic Modeling Analysis on Movie Subtitles with LDA 
#### (Case Study : English Movie with the highest and lowest ratings on IMDb)

**Code:** [`Topic Modeling Analysis on Movie Subtitles.ipynb`](https://github.com/hannarastya/Topic-Modeling-Analysis-on-Movie-Subtitles)

**Goal:** To compare the dominant topics between top-rated movies and low-rated movies based on the subtitles.

**Description:**  Performed topic modeling analysis on 6 movie dialogues files to explore topics across top rated and lowest rated English movies over 2 decades.

The project focused on analyzing a dataset of subtitle movies released between 1984 and 2024. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, release dates, and subtitles. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and analyzing the dominant topics using topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation method. 

**Skills:** data cleaning, NLP, topic modeling, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, NLTK, CountVectorizer, TfidfTransfomer, Numpy, gensim, pyLDAvis.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that top-rated films exhibit profound contemplation and intellectual depth, whereas low-rated films use cliched dialogue and recycled topics without providing the viewer with any intellectual difficulties.



### Sentiment Analysis on Movie Subtitles with Lexicon-Based Analysis 
#### (Case Study : English Movie with the highest and lowest ratings on IMDb)

**Goal:** To compare the emotion and sentiment betwwen top-rated movies and low-rated movies based on the subtitles. 

**Code:** [`Sentiment Analysis on Movie Subtitles.ipynb`](https://github.com/hannarastya/Sentiment-Analysis-on-Movie-Subtitles)

**Description:** The dataset contains of subtitles movies which divided by each category. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and sentiment analysis with Lexicon-Based Analysis method.

**Skills:** data cleaning, term frequency analysis, tokenization, sentiment analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** R, tm, tidytext, RWeka, dplyr, ggplot2, reshape2, wordcloud, textdata, and ggsci.

**Results:** Films with low ratings are more likely to contain negative sentiment and to be less successful in building a sense of trust and anticipation in the plot, those with top ratings typically exhibit the ability to balance positive sentiment with other elements like trust and anticipation
